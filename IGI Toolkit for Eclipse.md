# IGI Rules Toolkit (plugin) for Eclipse
Starting IGI 5.2.3.1, we've got an IGI Rule toolkit for the Eclipse development platform. It allows you to build rules in Eclipse, and if they are event-based rules you can also test them in Eclipse.

There is a toolkit version for 5.2.3.1, 5.2.4, 5.2.4.1 and 5.2.5.

## Download
The toolkit is contained within the *Database Installation Scripts and Tools* package in Passport Advantage or the
internal download site (e.g. _IBM Security Identity Governance and Intelligence Enterprise Edition v5.2.5 Database
Installation Scripts and Tools Multiplatform, Multilingual).

Contained in the download is the IGI Toolkit and Toolkit Guide with installation and use instructions.
